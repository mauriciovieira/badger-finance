Description

jsDOMenuBar is a cross-browser navigation menu bar that is based on DOM. 
It is an add-on to jsDOMenu that allows horizontal menu bars to be created 
and used together with jsDOMenu. You can configure it to be absolutely 
positioned, fixed positioned (does not move with the page during scrolling) or 
statically positioned. It supports unlimited menu bar items, and can be made 
draggable. jsDOMenuBar is 100% HTML/XHTML compliant, and is fully customizable 
through CSS. Every menu bar item can have an icon shown before the display 
text. Tested and works in many browsers such as Mozilla, Mozilla 
Firebird/Firefox, Netscape, Opera, Safari, Camino and Microsoft Internet
